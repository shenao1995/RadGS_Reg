## 1. Installation

We recommend using [Conda](https://docs.conda.io/en/latest/miniconda.html) to set up an environment. We tested the code on Ubuntu 20.04 with an RTX 3090 GPU. For installation issues on other platforms, please refer to [Gaussian Splatting](https://github.com/graphdeco-inria/gaussian-splatting).

```sh
# Download code
git clone https://github.com/Ruyi-Zha/r2_gaussian.git --recursive

# Install environment
SET DISTUTILS_USE_SDK=1 # Windows only
conda env create --file environment.yml
conda activate r2_gaussian

# Install TIGRE for data generation and initialization
wget https://github.com/CERN/TIGRE/archive/refs/tags/v2.3.zip
unzip v2.3.zip
pip install TIGRE-2.3/Python --no-build-isolation
```
